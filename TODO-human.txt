# TODO Items for Human

## Production Deployment Setup
- [ ] Configure production secrets by running: `./scripts/setup-secrets.sh prod`
  - GitHub OAuth Client ID and Secret (create production GitHub OAuth app)
  - JWT Private/Public keys (generate with OpenSSL)
  - Refresh token encryption key (AES-256)
  - Worker base URL (defaults to https://auth.mcp.r167.dev)

## GitHub OAuth App Setup
- [ ] Create production GitHub OAuth app with callback URL: `https://auth.mcp.r167.dev/auth/github/callback`

## DNS/Domain Configuration
- [ ] Ensure auth.mcp.r167.dev domain is properly configured in Cloudflare
- [ ] Verify custom domain routes to the worker (may take time for DNS propagation)

## Configuration
- [ ] Update `src/config.json` with production MCP servers and allowed users

## Testing
- [ ] After secrets are configured, test: `curl https://auth.mcp.r167.dev/health`
- [ ] Verify OAuth flow works end-to-end

## Notes
- Production worker is deployed and ready
- Worker will return 404s until secrets are configured
- Custom domain: https://auth.mcp.r167.dev
- Fallback URL: https://mcp-oauth-authorization-server.wmdurand.workers.dev
